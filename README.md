# Bags Landing (CRA + Tailwind v4)

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## What’s inside
- React 18 + CRA (react-scripts 5.0.1)
- Tailwind v4 via @tailwindcss/postcss
- Self-contained `LandingPage.tsx` (no external UI libs)

If Tailwind classes don’t appear, ensure `postcss.config.js` uses `@tailwindcss/postcss` as configured.
